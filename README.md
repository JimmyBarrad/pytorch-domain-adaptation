# pytorch-domain-adaptation

This is an unofficial pytorch implementation of algorithms for domain adaptation.

**Note that this is an ongoing project and I cannot fully reproduce the results. Suggestions are welcome!**

## List of algorithms
- From source to target and back: symmetric bi-directional adaptive GAN [Russo+, CVPR2018].
- Augmented Cyclic Adversarial Learning for Domain Adaptation [Hosseini-Asl+, arXiv2018].

## Requirements
- Python 3.5+
- PyTorch 0.4
- TorchVision
- TensorboardX
- batchup
- click
